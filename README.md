# 🎮 Unity Practice Journey

Welcome to **Unity Practice Journey**!  
This repository is designed for **absolute beginners** who want to learn Unity step by step, with **weekly practice exercises**.  

By following this repo, you will build a solid foundation in Unity, from creating simple shapes to developing interactive projects.

## 🚀 What is Unity Hub?
- **Unity Hub** is the central tool to create, manage, and organize your Unity projects.  
- You will use **Unity Editor (through Unity Hub)** to design scenes, create game objects, and build UI.  
- For coding, we connect Unity with **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** to write scripts in **C#**.
